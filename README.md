## Database Setup

If you don't have PostgreSQL installed yet, follow the instructions from the PostgreSQL step in [UpLeveled's System Setup Instructions](https://github.com/upleveled/system-setup/blob/master/readme.md).

Copy the `.env.example` file to a new file called `.env` (ignored from Git) and fill in the necessary information.
Then, connect to the built-in `postgres` database as administrator in order to create the database:

### Windows

If it asks for a password, use `postgres`.

```bash
psql -U postgres
```

### macOS

```bash
psql -U postgres
```

### Linux

```bash
sudo -U postgres psql
```

Once you have connected, run the following to create the database:

```bash
CREATE DATABASE <database name>;
CREATE USER <user name> WITH ENCRYPTED PASSWORD '<user password>';
GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON DATABASE <database name> TO <user name>;
\connect <database name>
CREATE SCHEMA <schema name> AUTHORIZATION <user name>;
```

Quit psql using the following command:

```bash
\q
```
